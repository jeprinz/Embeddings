Direct next step with embedding stuff
(I will come back to extrinsic ideas later, idk what will happen with them)

-- COMPLETE THE ONE DIRECTIONAL NBE ALREADY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Start with shallow, then work to augmented shallow.

If it doesn't work - better to find now
If it does work - good to have a concrete result

Next step - see if can parametrize the augmented embedding that gets evaled also
with SemT and Sem so that it can be two way! (Probably won't work, but worth a try...)
